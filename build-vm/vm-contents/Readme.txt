DSOL
-------------
The example shown is the example provided by the author. If the tool does not open on startup, run ./DSOL.sh from the terminal. This will bring up the web interface as described by the paper.

The client example provided by the author (Doodle Translator page) cannot be fully executed because the Doodle RESTful API is no longer supported (when actually trying to get a Doodle poll, it will not find the server). This client was not referenced in the paper, but is included in the DSOL website. However, this was just a chosen example and DSOL itself is still a working tool. A new application could be developed using DSOL. The example provided shows the actions and services provided by DSOL, as noted in the paper.

Correspondence has been started with Doodle to understand why the RESTful service is no longer supported, and if there is any alternative.
